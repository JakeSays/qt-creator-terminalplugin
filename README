Compilation

To compile the terminalplugin, you need to define two environment variables:

1. QTC_SOURCE: source directory of Qt Creator
2. QTC_BUILD: build directory of Qt Creator

Those variables should be absolute paths and should be defined for the qmake step.

Then 'mkdir build; cd build; qmake ../terminal.pro && make;'
